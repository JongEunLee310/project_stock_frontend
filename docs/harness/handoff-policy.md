# Handoff Policy

Claude Code hands implementation work to Codex using `.codex/task-template.md`.

When the change introduces a new domain, table, external dependency, or architectural decision, a design record must exist before handoff, per `design-record-policy.md`. Reference it from the handoff task.

## Output Location

Completed handoffs are written to `.codex/tasks/task-<NNN>-<slug>.md`, using `.codex/task-template.md` as the section template. `<NNN>` is a zero-padded sequence number and `<slug>` is a short kebab-case summary. One file per handoff.

## Required Fields

- Source Issue
- Task Summary
- Goal
- Background
- Implementation Scope
- Out of Scope
- Protected Files
- Requirements
- Test Requirements
- Verification Commands
- Documentation Impact
- ADR Need
- Failure Record Need
- Risk Level
- Expected Output
- Rules

## Stop Conditions

Claude Code should stop instead of handing off when:

- The issue goal is unclear.
- Required decisions are architectural and unresolved.
- A design record is required per `design-record-policy.md` but has not been written.
- Protected file changes are needed but not approved.
- Verification expectations are missing.
- Risk is high and human approval is needed.
- The requested change conflicts with existing policy.

## Handoff Quality

A good handoff is narrow, testable, and explicit about what Codex must not change.

## Codex Execution

Claude Code may invoke `codex exec` automatically as the implementation step, **under the default sandbox only** (`read-only` / `workspace-write`), passing the handoff document as the brief (per `docs/decisions/ADR-005-allow-claude-code-to-invoke-codex-exec.md`). Automation does not remove the handoff: the written scope / out-of-scope / verification contract above is still produced and passed to Codex as the prompt. The current Codex CLI runs `codex exec` correctly, so no specific pinned version is required (see `.codex/CODEX_SETUP_NOTES.md`).

If an automated run appears to make no progress, confirm it is **actually hung** — no new output or file activity within a reasonable window, not merely a long-running step — before retrying. Cap retries at a small bounded number; if the run stays hung after those attempts, fall back to manual execution (ADR-002) instead of looping.

`--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` and `-s danger-full-access` must **never** be used in an automated Claude Code workflow. If Codex's default sandbox cannot run a task, stop and ask the human per `docs/harness/human-gate-policy.md` instead of escalating Codex's privileges — fall back to manual execution (ADR-002), never to elevated access. Mandatory human gate conditions still apply **before** the automated implementation step runs.

## PR Grouping

A handoff document or design record is never opened as a standalone PR on its own. After Codex implements the scope, the design, handoff, and implementation land together in a single PR, so reviewers see the rationale and the code in one place and no doc-only empty PR is left behind. The handoff itself does not wait for a separate PR — it can be delegated directly per the Codex Execution steps above.
